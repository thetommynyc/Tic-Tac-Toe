 # Tic-Tac-Toe Tommy Edition

 ### A Simple Game With A Twist

 #### Description "An Idea"

 Welcome fellow new developers, an idea occured to me at 4am this morning seeing as the other day in class I failed to grasp the Javascript concepts and lost half of my brain cells & local synapse connections in the process I thought to myself, how can I solve this problem. How can I build this game. To make it simple I have no clue what I'm doing but I have an idea of what I want it to look like and how I want it to feel when me as a user would play it. I decided this morning rather than make a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game I would challenge myself and create something thats me...Extra and All. Here's my go at Tic-Tac-Toe with a Twist. If you'd like to contribute to the code I added a contribute section below, Good Hunting!
 
 #### What would I enjoy as a "user"?
 
 ##### As a user...

 - I want to be able have two players

 - I want to be able have my name/computers name displayed on screen depending on whose turn it is 

 - I want to be able to take turns

 - I want to be able to display "x" and "o" on the grid

 - I want to be able to win once I get 3 of any "x" or "o" in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally

 - I want to see who has won and who has lost

 - I want to know if there is a tie 

 - I want to be able to play again after the game is over
#### What Can I do to make it even better?

 ##### Bonus Features (features I would add if I didn't want to play 'Civilization 5')
 
 - choosing which player went first through a virtual coin flip on screen

 - a give up button for when the computer is being extra and the player is not in the mood to play 

 - a custom image renderer to replace "x" and "o" with images chosen by the player to get a little fun spin on the game ex. "x" being replace with Kim Kardashian and "O" being replaced with "Kanye West"

 ##### Visualization & Design #Sexy

 - a luxurius, elegant design layout
 - gold brushed border
 - silver "o" and gold "x" displayed on screen
 - full matte black background
 - bronze gold inner grid lines
 - Font: Luxurious Roman
